# django-examples

This project contains my in-work code for the youtube python-django set of tutorials here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oT1A1KKf0SI&list=PLNTiG-RQbbG4RmIqUMq_j4vinv4OGABHJ

To use you will need to:

        Start a django project
        python manage.py syncdb
        python manage.py collectsources

I was not able to get tutorial 16 to work, but if you do, you will also need to install:

        pip install django-tastypie
        pip install defusedxml "lxml>=3"
